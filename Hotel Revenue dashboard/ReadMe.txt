Hotel Management Dashboard

In this project, I utilized SQL and Power BI to analyze data from a hotel chain. The dataset included information on hotel revenue, customer types, market segments, and various other factors. My aim was to address the following key questions:
- What is the total revenue generated from the hotels?
- How has our hotel revenue trended over the years? Is it growing or declining?
- What is the revenue breakdown by hotel type? Are there any differences in revenue growth between the two hotel types?
- What is the hotel typeâ€™s average daily rate (ADR)?
- Calculate the average discount from the hotel chain.
- Calculates the total number of nights stayed by guest.
- Count the number of required car parking spaces.
- What is the market segment distribution revenue?
- Calculate the revenue by customer type.
- Calculate the revenue, count of required car parking spaces, and parking percentage for each arrival year and hotel.

The dataset spanned multiple years, including 2018, 2019, and 2020, and included information on meal costs and market segments. I
I used Microsoft SQL Server to create a database for the project. 
I developed SQL queries to extract the required information, employing various SQL functions to retrieve the necessary data for analysis. I then connected Power BI to the SQL database, enabling the creation of interactive and visually appealing visualizations for effective data exploration.
